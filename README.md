# Save-The-Prisoner
This C# program determines which prisoner will receive the last candy in a circular distribution. The `saveThePrisoner` function calculates the position using modular arithmetic based on the number of prisoners `n`, candies `m`, and starting position `s`. The `Main` method reads multiple test cases, calls the function for each, and outputs the result.
